### Built with

### What I learned
I learnt about optimizing images for the web, optimizing animations and transitions, how to consume an API using JS Promises and how to observe elements efficiently with the IntersectionObserver API.
<br>I also learnt about the animation preference of users (especially those with impairment) and how to respect them.
